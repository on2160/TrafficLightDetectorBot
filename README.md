# Traffic Light Parsing Bot

This is a project that I worked on for a few weeks in my summer work with Professor Zussman's Electrical Engineering Group under
the guidance of Mahshid Ghasemi.

This program, given a file input and dimensions of the light, can read to a new file an mp4 containing
the traffic light labelled with its status in real time. This can also be further configured to read to a database with the status of the light.
